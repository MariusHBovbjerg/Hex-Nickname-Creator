# Hex-Nickname-Creator
A small program to allow easy to make Hex-colour-coded names in Minecraft using Essentials /nick and coolors.co's gradient creator.

There may be bugs present that I have yet to weed out, as well as some sloppy code.

There are a few things I will be polishing over time, whenever I find time and will to fix em.

The code is functionally ready to work though.
